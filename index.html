      <h2><u>THE NATIONAL ANTHEM</u></h2>
      <p>
        God bless our homeland Ghana, And make our nation great and strong, Bold
        to defend for ever, The cause of Freedom and of Right. Fill our hearts
        with true humility Make us cherish fearless honesty, And help us to
        resist oppressor's rule With all our will and might for evermore. Hail
        to thy name, O Ghana, To thee we make our solemn vow: Steadfast to build
        together A nation strong in Unity; With our gifts of mind and strength
        of arm, Whether night or day, in mist or storm, In every need what'er
        the call may be, To serve thee, Ghana, now and evermore. Raise high the
        flag of Ghana And one with Africa advance; Black star of hope and
        honour, To all who thirst for liberty; Where the banner of Ghana freely
        flies, May the way of freedom truly lie Arise, arise, O sons of
        Ghanaland, And under God march on for evermore. Raise high the flag of
        Ghana And one with Africa advance; Black star of hope and honour, To all
        who thirst for liberty; Where the banner of Ghana freely flies, May the
        way of freedom truly lie Arise, arise, O sons of Ghanaland, And under
        God march on for evermore.
